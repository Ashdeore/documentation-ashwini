- I've tested all the python function from the Splashkit website guides such as Animations, Audio, Camera, Graphics, etc. And there is 1 error,
- From the Splashkit camera guides. In line 49 fill_rectangle() takes 5 positional arguments but 6 were given.

## Recommendations _[Optional â€“ remove heading/section if not used!]_

Often based on any open issues/risks Identified. You may state that another spike is required for
the team to resolve new issues identified (or) indicate that this spike has increased the teams
confidence in XYZ and should move on.\*

- Check the Function Argument: Confirm that fill_rectangle() indeed expects five arguments. Usually, the arguments might be 'color', 'x', 'y', 'width', 'height'.
- Review the Argument Passed: Ensure that there are only 5 argument.
- Update code if necessary: Might need to implement the additional feature seperately or modify how to call fill_rectangle().
